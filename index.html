        <h1>Hi Kak Bee!</h1>
        <p>
          Happy special birthday! Today is a day to celebrate your wonderful
          existence. In the journey of life, I am grateful to have you by my
          side. <br /><br />
          Between the oceans, galaxies, and the moon, I'm lucky to be so close
          to you, I'm happy to be loved by you. hehehe<br /><br />
          This year kak bee didn't come back to jogja, which means it's the
          first year we didn't celebrate your birthday together. But my prayers
          for kak bee are always between the five prayer times! <br /><br />
          Kak Bee, I hope you are healthy in Jakarta, don't cry, don't be
          discouraged. even though I can't be 24/7 with kak bee, but if there is
          anything, I am ready to be the first person there. In Jogja, it's
          really lonely without kak bee, really cuamn in the morning to go to
          college, go home early in the morning to meet mama and papa, that's
          all. Who misses the time together yesterday? me<br /><br />
          Hopefully this year will be a year full of happiness in the hereafter,
          success, and love, given a blessed long life, smooth work, wish you
          all the best. Thank you for being a part of my life story. Happy
          birthday, and may each of your days be filled with joy and great
          accomplishments! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚
